JAVA
Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, 
and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed 
with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use 
garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++.

Visual Basic .NET
C# and VB.NET are syntactically very different, that is where the differences 
mostly end. Microsoft developed both of these languages to be part of the same 
.NET Framework development platform.They compile to the same intermediate 
language (IL), which runs against the same .NET Framework runtime libraries.

Python
Python is implemented as an interpreted language while C# is compiled. 
Both this implementations have their benefits and drawbacks. Performance-wise, 
C# is faster due to the optimizations provided by the Common Language 
Infrastructure (CLI) framework.

C and C++
C - an older programming language that is described as Hands-on. 
As the programmer you must tell the program to do everything. Also this 
language will let you do almost anything. It does not support object orriented 
code. Thus no classes. 

C++ - an extention language per se of C. In C code ++ means increment 1. 
Thus C++ is better than C. It allows for highly controlled object orriented 
code. Once again a very hands on language that goes into MUCH detail. 

C# - Full object orriented code resembling the style of C/C++ code. This is 
really closer to JAVA. C# is the latest version of the C style languages 
and is very good for developing web applications.
