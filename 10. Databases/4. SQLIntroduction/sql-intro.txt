SQL: a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL
consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language.The
scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation
and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as,
and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes
procedural elements.

DML: a data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a
computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and
updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes
also considered a component of DML.
Data manipulation languages have their functional capability organized by the
initial word in a statement, which is almost always a verb. In the case of
SQL, these verbs are:
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...
UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...

DDL: a data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax
similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures,
especially database schemas.
DDL Statements:
ALTER
CREATE
DISABLE TRIGGER
DROP
ENABLE TRIGGER
TRUNCATE TABLE
UPDATE STATISTICS
